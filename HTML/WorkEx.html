            <h2>Hy-Vee Warehouse</h2>
            <h3>Floor Worker</h3>
            <p>May 2020 - Aug 2022</p>
            <p>1801 Osceola Ave, Chariton, IA 50049</p>
            <p>This job was a high school job and taught me important lessons in work ethic and the importance of getting work done while being efficent. At Hy-Vee I was tasked with several different jobs while I was there including but not limited to 
                loading semis with product efficently as well as paying close attention to possible flaws in the product, following saftey standards while opperating large equipment, staying aware of my surrondings to ensure the most saftey possible.
                Even though it was just a highschool job it taught me many important lessons and it was almost sad to leave to continue my education into Software Development.

            <h3>Control-Link Opperator/Customer Help Desk</h3>
            <p>June 2023 - Current</p>
            <p>100 1st Ave W, Oskaloosa, IA 52577</p>
            <p>This job was a job that I saw avalible at a career fair at college and was very interested in Musco as a company. I have learned a lot about Musco and what its mission is. I think it has made me learn to deal with stressful and escalated situations
                using customer service techniques while troubleshooting on the spot to find issues and help the customer. As my first job being in a office it was a delight to wear more formal clothes and keep a cleaner workspace. Musco is hopefully the start of my
                career in Software Development. </p>
